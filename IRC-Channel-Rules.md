Rule #1: Do not say the full name of anybody famous. In short, do not ping anyone that is an op (has @ in front of nick) or slowpoke or Tahg.

Rule #2: Do not ask about ETAs. This is true in all Minecraft channels on Esper.

Rule #3: Do not PM people without permission. It is bad form.

Rule #4: Do not abuse the bots

Rule #5: Do not ask about the future of the mod in the era of the Modding API.

Rule #6: Do not ask for op/voice. It will be given if you deserve it.

Rule #7: Pastebin exists for a reason. Use it if you have more than 5 lines of code to share.

Rule #8: Logs or it never happened.

Rule #9: We the ops reserve the right to kick/ban anyone.

Rule #10: luacs doesn't take any money from the FE kitty anyway, so he doesn't care if you donated.

Rule #11: Logging in, pinging a dev, then logging out will get you a permanent ip ban. It's bloody annoying.

Rule #12: There is not, never has been, and never will be any integration with BukkitForge or MCPC.  Period.  End of discussion.
