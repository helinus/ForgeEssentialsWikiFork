If you are using the config:
<code>Format is like this: [amount]x<id>[:meta]</code>
So for 64 stone with no meta-data it would be:
<code>64x1</code>
<code>64</code> is the amount and <code>1</code> is stone's id.
If stone had a meta-data, lets say 1, for instance it would look like this.
<code>64x1:1</code>
