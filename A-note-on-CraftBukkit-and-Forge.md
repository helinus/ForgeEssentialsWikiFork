Do note that, with FE being a Forge-based mod, we do not and will not officially support the Bukkit platform.
Sure, it's a great API, but unfortunately Bukkit is no longer as versatile as Forge.
There is a sanity check implemented to see if you are attempting to run FE on any form of ForgeBukkit layer, due to incompatibilities caused by certain Bukkit API parts (superperms, namely).

# Do not come to the FE team with any crashes caused by running FE alongside any form of Bukkit!

The sanity checks can be disabled, look in your main.cfg file.
