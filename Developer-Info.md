This page is generally for modders looking to add support for ForgeEssentials to their mod.

# Javadocs
Javadocs are available from https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/ForgeEssentialsMain/blob/master/APIjavadoc-1.2.0.357.zip. We try to keep this updated, but sometimes the API may fluctuate too much, in which case kindly refer to our example implementation of the API at https://github.com/ForgeEssentials/FECapes .

# Permission nodes
The permission node syntax we recommend goes as this: `[modid].[category].[subcat|node name]`.
